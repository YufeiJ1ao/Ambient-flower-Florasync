# Ambient-flower-Adonis
//An arduino practicle of Ambient flower. The input is moisture level of the soil, output is the colour of the LED ring light.// 
Colour menu: Magenta means soil are dry, aqua means soil are at the perfect moisture level. Blue means there are too much water. //
The led ring light lights up depend on the time delay, 1 single led light bulb lights up each second 
therefore if the soil moisture level changes rapidly so as the led light. If the moisture level becomes too dramatic you may see three different color on the same ring light. This machine are able to accuratly display the moisture level of soil with different colour overtime.
